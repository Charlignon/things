## Welcome !

Thank you for your interest into my silly little wplace projects! Here's a list of all the sprites I'm working on
If you want to contribute, you can read this and also send me a MP on Discord so we can coordinate :D

**Location:** [wplace link](https://wplace.live/?lat=48.03231497803307&lng=-0.22649447197266803&zoom=13.552414683876812)

**Blue Marble coords:** (Tl X: 1022, Tl Y: 711, Px X: 711, Px Y: 639)

## How to setup Blue Marble
Blue Marble is a tool that allow you to overlay a sprite templace over wplace. Here's how to set it up
1. Install [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
   - These tools allow you to run scripts in your browser ⚠️ You should be very careful of what you install ! Malicious scripts could access all your data and even act on your behalf. I can vouch for the one below.
2. Get the [Blue Marble script](https://github.com/SwingTheVine/Wplace-BlueMarble?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-instructions)
3. Refresh the wplace website
4. Navigate to the location given for each project, and click the origin pixel. Alternatively, add the coordinates manually in the Blue Marble popup
5. Upload the given sprite
6. Click Create
7. Start drawing !
